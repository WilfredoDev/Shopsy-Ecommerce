# Shopsy Ecommerce

This e-commerce application is developed using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, with state management facilitated by Redux. The app provides a comprehensive platform for buying and selling products, featuring user-friendly product listings, detailed product pages, and a seamless shopping cart experience. Users can register, log in, browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout with secure payment processing. The backend, built with Express and Node.js, ensures efficient data management and scalability, while the frontend, crafted with React and Redux, delivers a responsive and engaging user experience.
